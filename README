# DNA Sequence Classification with DNABERT

This project implements a DNA sequence classification model using the DNABERT architecture. It processes DNA sequences, tokenizes them into k-mers, and trains a model to classify the sequences based on genotype.

## Features

- Data preprocessing of DNA sequences
- Tokenization of sequences into k-mers
- Implementation of DNABERT model for sequence classification
- Training and evaluation pipeline
- Data exploration and visualization

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dna-sequence-classification.git
   cd dna-sequence-classification
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Data Preprocessing:
   ```
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```
   This script downloads the DNA sequences, processes them, and saves the results in a CSV file.

2. Model Training:
   ```
   python src/model_training.py
   ```
   This script loads the processed data, trains the DNABERT model, and evaluates its performance.

3. Data Exploration:
   Open the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` directory for data visualization and analysis.
